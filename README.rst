Spydes
------

Well documented, Python3-exclusive playing cards in four suits, with and without
jokers.

It's time to let go of Python 2, but I'm not about to rip it out of someone
else's project. I'm not a jerk.

How to use it
-------------
You can instantiate a Deck() from which to draw(), cut(\*weights), or
shuffle().
